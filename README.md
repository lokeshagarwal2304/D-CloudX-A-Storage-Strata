## 💡 Real-World Use Cases

* ✅ **Enterprise data storage** without vendor lock-in.
* ✅ **College/University** project repositories (tamper-proof + shareable).
* ✅ **Govt records** storage with transparency & traceability.
* ✅ **Personal drive** where *only you* hold the decryption key.
* ✅ **AI training datasets** stored privately yet immutably.

---

## 🧠 Future Scope

* 🔄 **Offline Sync Mode** with Swarm/BTFS.
* 🧩 **Plugin Support** (like Notion, Drive etc.)
* 📱 **Mobile App** with biometric + voice unlock.
* 📍 **Location-based Pinning** to store data near your city/server.
* 📜 **Patent Filing** underway for the core architectural design.
